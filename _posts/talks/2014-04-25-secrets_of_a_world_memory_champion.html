<p class="description">
  You don't have a bad memory, you were just never taught how to use it. We are
  going to practice several powerful memory techniques that have been perfected
  by memory contest champions over the last hundred years. By the end of this
  talk, you will know how to quickly memorize a foreign language, driving
  directions, phone conversations, the entire Chuck Norris filmography, your
  friend's credit card number, a shuffled deck of playing cards, and the name
  of every person you meet at RailsConf.
