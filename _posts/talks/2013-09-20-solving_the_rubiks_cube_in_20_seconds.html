  Come to San Francisco as a Rubyist, leave as a speedcuber. We are going to
  use Ruby, a video camera, and an insane amount of live demonstration to learn
  how to solve the Rubik's Cube in less than 20 seconds. You will leave this
  talk knowing which cube to buy, which of the five most popular solving
  methods you should be learning, how to practice for speed, where to ask
  questions, and how Ruby can help teach you to be the fastest speedcuber in
  town. People are solving the Rubik's Cube quicker today than any time in
  history and there's a reason why.
