category: talks
---

<p class="description">
  SOA is hard. Learn how Square is approaching this problem today with JRuby
  and where we hope to be in the future. We'll go from `git init` to `cap
  deploy`, covering Square's approach to testing and service isolation,
  dependency management, API documentation, code quality metrics, data seeding,
  schema versioning, logging, exception handling, security and password
  management, deployment and more.
