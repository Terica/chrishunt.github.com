  Hi! My name is Chris and like to do lots of things. My current obsession is
  <strong>adventure motorcycling</strong> - a strange sport where I travel for
  many days at a time in remote places on my dual-sport motorcycle. I share my
  photos on
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/huntca">Instagram</a> and a map of my
  <a href="http://www.mytracks.co/map.html">gps tracks</a> on
  <a href="http://www.mytracks.co/">mytracks.co</a>.

  Before I discovered motorcycling, I spent my time solving the
  <strong>Rubik's Cube</strong>
  <a href="/talks/2014/10/24/solving_the_rubiks_cube_blindfolded.html">
  blindfolded</a> (or
  <a href="/talks/2013/09/20/solving_the_rubiks_cube_in_20_seconds.html">
  less than 20 seconds</a>), memorizing
  <a href="/talks/2014/04/25/secrets_of_a_world_memory_champion.html">
  shuffled decks of cards</a>,
  creating <a href="http://www.healthyhacker.com/">podcast episodes</a>,
  or building other <strong>fun side projects</strong> on
  <a href="https://github.com/chrishunt">GitHub</a>.

  When I'm at home, I'm usually sitting in front of my computer getting paid to
  make websites. I am a <strong>computer programmer</strong>. I currently work
  at <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, but have also built things for
  <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a>,
  <a href="https://www.climate.com/">Climate Corporation</a>,
  <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>,
  and the <a href="https://www.progeny.net">US Department of Defense</a>.
