### Condition

Please watch the video below (it's 3 minutes, 30 seconds) for a tour of the exterior and interior of
the van.

The back-right window (seen at 0:45 in video) is missing, but screen is still
attached. Another Hehr awning screened window will need to be installed (on the
existing mounts) if you don't like the ventilation. I wanted to point this out
explicitly just in case you don't see it while watching the video.

There are no mechanical issues and van was serviced regularly (every 3k) at
Nissan dealer. Oil changed at 3k, air filter at 6k, and tires rotated at 3k or
6k if needed.
